## Update Your Code

After creating all prompts in LangSmith, update your `backend/retrieval_graph/prompts.py`:

```python
# Replace the existing prompt names with your new ones
ROUTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    client.pull_prompt("bali-love-router-prompt")
    .messages[0]
    .prompt.template
)

GENERATE_QUERIES_SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    client.pull_prompt("bali-love-generate-queries-prompt")
    .messages[0]
    .prompt.template
)

MORE_INFO_SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    client.pull_prompt("bali-love-more-info-prompt")
    .messages[0]
    .prompt.template
)

RESEARCH_PLAN_SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    client.pull_prompt("bali-love-research-plan-prompt")
    .messages[0]
    .prompt.template
)

GENERAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    client.pull_prompt("bali-love-general-prompt")
    .messages[0]
    .prompt.template
)

RESPONSE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    client.pull_prompt("bali-love-response-prompt")
    .messages[0]
    .prompt.template
)
```

## Testing

After setup, test these queries:
- "Show me wedding venues in Uluwatu"
- "I need a venue for 200 guests"  
- "What's available at Alila Uluwatu?"
- "Tell me about beachfront venues"
- "What services do you offer?"

The router should classify venue/event queries as "research" and trigger database searches.
