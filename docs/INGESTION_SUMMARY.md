# Bubble Data Ingestion Summary

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Verified Bubble API Structure
- Discovered 31 working data types in your Bubble app
- Found that the API uses case-sensitive naming (both `Event` and `event` exist)
- Confirmed authentication works with your API token
- Base URL: `https://app.bali.love/api/1.1/obj/{datatype}`

### 2. Successfully Ingested Data

We ingested thousands of records from your Bubble app into Pinecone, including:

#### Events (2000+ records)
- Wedding events with details like contact names, codes, and status
- Event types and categories
- Both uppercase `Event` and lowercase `event` data types

#### Venues
- Venues like Alila Uluwatu, Stone Villa Uluwatu, Renaissance Hotel
- Venue details including area, capacity, and event types supported

#### Products/Services  
- Service offerings like "Live Painting" packages (Platinum, Silver, Gold)
- Product categories and pricing models

#### Training Data
- Sample training modules from our earlier test
- Employee training plans

### 3. Created Query Tools

Two main scripts for working with the data:

1. **`bubble_venue_ingestion.py`** - Ingests data from Bubble to Pinecone
2. **`query_bubble_data.py`** - Interactive tool to query the ingested data

## Current State

Your RAG chatbot can now answer questions about:

- **Wedding venues**: "Show me wedding venues in Uluwatu"
- **Events**: "What wedding events are coming up?"
- **Services**: "What event services are available?"
- **Specific venues**: "Tell me about Alila Uluwatu"

## Example Queries That Work

```
- "wedding venues in Uluwatu"
- "recent wedding events" 
- "event services and products"
- "venues with large capacity"
- "Tell me about upcoming weddings"
```

## Data Structure Examples

### Event Record
```json
{
  "name": "Wedding",
  "status": "Lead",
  "code": "LE080624OM",
  "contactName": "Bride_Admin & Groom_Admin",
  "isWedding": true,
  "eventType": "1725701630094x128340982699917310"
}
```

### Venue Record
```json
{
  "name": "Alila Uluwatu",
  "area": "Uluwatu",
  "seats": 150,
  "eventTypes": ["Wedding", "Corporate"],
  "isPublish": true
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the chatbot** with venue/event queries through the frontend
2. **Schedule regular updates** to keep data fresh
3. **Add more data types** like Booking, Guest, Vendor as needed
4. **Improve search relevance** by tuning metadata filters
5. **Add semantic caching** for common queries

## Important Notes

- The ingestion found many more records than initially shown in our tests
- Some data types have different structures between uppercase/lowercase versions
- The vector store now contains real production data from your Bubble app
- Queries work best when filtering by `source_type`

## To Re-run Ingestion

```bash
# Full ingestion (may take time with lots of data)
python bubble_venue_ingestion.py

# Query the data
python query_bubble_data.py
```

The system is now ready to answer questions about your venues, events, and services!
